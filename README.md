## IBM Coursera Advanced Data Science Capstone. Breast Cancer Classification.
According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, except for skin cancers. Today, a womanâ€™s chance of getting breast cancer is 1 in 8 chances. The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about 2.6%, or a 1 in 38 chance. Breast cancer still causes about 685.000 deaths annually in the world. Breast cancer research opens the door to finding better ways to prevent, detect, and treat breast cancer. 
Early detection, often through screening (mammogram, breast ultrasound, MRI), can catch the disease when it is most treatable. Its detection ability depends on tumor size and breast tissue density. 

Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset is a public dataset. The dataset contains a description and size of specific cells in the breast with diagnosis. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous).

A technology choice is open source: Python and its libraries are good supported and actively updated tools. We do not use ApacheSpark, PySpark because Our dataset is too small. 
Single computer is enough to process data. List of the libraries: 
-	pandas and numpy to explore and transform data  
-	matplotlib and seaborn for visualization 
-	sklearn, imblearn, keras, tensorflow to build and evaluate models
